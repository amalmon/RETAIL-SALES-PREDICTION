# RETAIL-SALES-PREDICTION
regression based project in machine learning

## Problem Statement
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. 


Currently, 
Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales 
for up to six weeks in advance. 

Store sales are influenced by many factors, 
including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and 
locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their 
unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## Approaches

   1.Understanding the business problem and the datasets
   2.Data cleaning and preprocessing
   3.Exploratory Data Analysis:
   4.Feature Manipulations on Data
   5.Modeling
## Results

In a businessâ€™s point of view, these sales forecasts are done consistently to 
improve their sales forecasting models as they directly impact their decision-
making process, goals, plans and growth strategies. The main objective of the 
sales prediction is to make a good figure of upcoming expected sales
When the sales forecast is accurate, operations go smoothly and future planning 
for the company's growth is done efficiently.
by this analysis Random Forest Tuned Model gave the best results and, which 
indicates that all the trends and patterns that could be captured by these models 
without overfitting were done. It built a good model to predict sales with a 97% 
test regression score. It is a good level of accuracy and also it showing a good 
range of prediction without much variations

## Challenges

Model selection and dealing with independent features are the main 
challenging part we were faced
Needed more computational time for model preparation
Dealing such big data with less space of ram has also become a little 
challenging.

## Future Scopes
